# Kents Simple Banking system
Please install python 3 to run my software.

Bank_System_Main.py is the the file you want to run and Account.py is where the class Account is stored.

Kents ATM system has the following features:
  - Allows someone to add a bank account based on NRIC and check if the NRIC was previously used in other accounts.
  - Deposit and Withdraw money. Note that you cannot withdraw more than what you have deposited.
  - View all user accounts at a glance (will require a password which is also "password" to access)
  - Delete user account can also be done ((will require a password which is also "password" to access)
  - saves user account information into a text file (Acc.txt) when you exit the session so you can load user information when you restart the program.

Just use the Main Menu to type in the function serial number you want and continue to use the software.

The UML diagram is also zipped together in the same folder.
